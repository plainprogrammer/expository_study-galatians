# Galatians 3:1-14

...

## A Harsh Inquiry

> O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified. Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith?
>
> (Galatians 3:1-2 ESV)

...

## Begun by the Spirit

> Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh? Did you suffer so many things in vain—if indeed it was in vain?
> 
> (Galatians 3:3-4 ESV)

...

## Faith, or the Law

> Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith — just as Abraham "believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness"?
>
> (Galatians 3:5-6 ESV)

Paul introduces now his Abrahamic argument to establish the foolishness of what the Galatians have accepted with regards to their submitting to the Law, rather than abiding in faith. He reiterates that it was not works of the Law that brought about the presence and works of the Spirit amongst the Galatians.

### Consider Briefly

1. What do you know about the covenant made with Abraham by God? 
2. Read Genesis 15:1-6

---

In the verses that follow the ones we just read from Genesis 15, God enacts the covenant with Abraham through sacrifices offered by Abraham. An interesting detail of the covenant made with Abraham is that God made no conditions upon it. It is like the covenant of redemption promised in the curse made upon the serpent when Adam and Eve were driven out of Eden: "I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel" (Genesis 3:15 ESV).
 
Obedience to any form of law were not obligations of either of these covenants. God's intention to redeem for Himself a people is not dependent on obedience, but on His mere grace. God sent the seed of Even that crushed the head of the serpent in Jesus, who was and is also the true heir to the Abrahamic covenant, which is founding upon faith in God and brings about a credited righteousness.

---

### Consider Briefly

1. What does it mean to receive a credit for something?
2. Read Romans 5:12 & 6:23; Isaiah 64:6

---

When we read that God counted Abraham's belief in His promise to him as righteousness we begin to see the economy of grace that God has worked with throughout redemptive history. Our sin creates an enormous debt that only God can deal with. Our good deeds are not sufficient to overcome the burden of debt that sin lays upon us. Our good deeds are themselves, unclean and filthy in the sight of God. We need a credited righteousness that only comes by the will and Spirit of God through faith.

## People of Faith

> Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you shall all the nations be blessed.” So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.
> 
> (Galatians 3:7-9 ESV)

---

### Consider Briefly

1. Romans 9:6-8
2. Who are the true children of Abraham?
3. How is the promise Paul calls attention to in this passage fulfilled?

---

The very heart of Paul's argument is made here: that only those who have faith are truly Abraham's offspring. This is the explicit proclamation that God has always worked via an economy of grace when it comes to spiritual redemption. Paul notes that this promise that is made in Genesis 15, and reiterated elsewhere is a proclamation of the Gospel.

The fulfillment of this promise is Jesus Christ and the extending of salvation, by grace through faith, to the Gentiles. The world is blessed in and through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. A multitude of physical descendants is not the fulfillment of the Abrahamic covenant, the Gospel is. And, the proclamation of the Gospel to the nations is both a fulfillment and ongoing reiteration of this covenant.

## Cursed by the Law

> For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, “Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the Book of the Law, and do them.” Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for “The righteous shall live by faith.” But the law is not of faith, rather “The one who does them shall live by them.”
>
> (Galatians 3:10-12 ESV)

---

### Consider Briefly

1. Read Deuteronomy 27:26-28:2 and Matthew 5:17-20
2. What is 'The Book of the Law' Paul refers to?
3. Can the letter and spirit of the Law be kept perfectly?

---

In these verses Paul returns to addressing his opponents by noting that what they teach brings a curse with it. The expectation of God is that obedience to the Law must be perfect in order to be effective. There is no room for imperfection if anyone wants to enter the presence of God based upon their own merit. But, as Paul notes, no one is declared to be justified before God, by the Law. This is because no one can keep the Law perfectly, that is why the sacrificial system was put in place, in the first place.

---

### Consider Briefly

1. Read Leviticus 4:1-2 and Hebrews 9:22

---

Chapter four of Leviticus addresses offerings made for unintentional sins, and it addresses the offerings to be made from the priesthood down to the common person. If salvation could truly be had through obedience to the Law then sacrifice would not truly be necessary, obedience would be all that is required. Yet, the sacrifices were necessary and they were necessary continually. Without blood being shed for sin, there was no means to even maintain an appearance of obedience to the Law.

And, it is this constant need for sacrifice that reveals that the Law can not actually save us. Good works are not enough to justify us before God because our good works don't outweigh or counteract our sin in any way at all. As we already read in Isaiah, our good works are like filthy garments, and we think those will please God? Only faith in what God is able to do pleases Him.

## Redeemed in Christ

> Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree”—so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.
>
> (Galatians 3:13-14 ESV)

---

### Consider Briefly

1. How did Jesus become a curse?
2. How did Jesus suffering benefit us?

---

This passage makes reference to another passage in Deuteronomy 21:23 regarding the curse that belongs to those who are executed as a public display. Jesus was executed as such a public display, but the curse he bore was not just the curse of shame. He also bore the curse of our sin.

---

### Consider Briefly

1. Read John 3:34-36 and Romans 5:8-11

---

Apart from Christ we must bear God's wrath ourselves, but the shed blood of Christ is able to satisfy the wrath of God, which was poured out on Jesus at the cross. This transaction, whereby Jesus satisfies the curse of sin through His death is the heart of the Gospel, and it goes in concert with the promise of life that is made manifest through the resurrection. We are made Abraham's children by faith, given the Spirit by faith, and ultimately saved because of faith in the finished work in Jesus, alone. Our faith can not rest upon our works, because that subjects us to the Law and the Law is impossible to fulfill perfectly. We need God's grace and that grace is made available to us by faith.

## For Next Time

1. Read Galataisn 3:15-4:7
2. Consider, in light of these verse, why God gave the Law to Israel?
3. What, if any, place does the Law have in the life of the Church?
