# Galatians 3:1-14

...

## A Harsh Inquiry

> O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified. Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith?
>
> (Galatians 3:1-2 ESV)

...

## Begun by the Spirit

> Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh? Did you suffer so many things in vain—if indeed it was in vain?
> 
> (Galatians 3:3-4 ESV)

...

## Faith, or the Law

> Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith — just as Abraham "believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness"?
>
> (Galatians 3:5-6 ESV)

Paul introduces now his Abrahamic argument to establish the foolishness of what the Galatians have accepted with regards to their submitting to the Law, rather than abiding in faith. He reiterates that it was not works of the Law that brought about the presence and works of the Spirit amongst the Galatians.

### Consider Briefly

1. What do you know about the covenant made with Abraham by God? 
2. Read Genesis 15:1-6

---

In the verses that follow the ones we just read from Genesis 15, God enacts the covenant with Abraham through sacrifices offered by Abraham. An interesting detail of the covenant made with Abraham is that God made no conditions upon it. It is like the covenant of redemption promised in the curse made upon the serpent when Adam and Eve were driven out of Eden: "I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel" (Genesis 3:15 ESV).
 
Obedience to any form of law were not obligations of either of these covenants. God's intention to redeem for Himself a people is not dependent on obedience, but on His mere grace. God sent the seed of Even that crushed the head of the serpent in Jesus, who was and is also the true heir to the Abrahamic covenant, which is founding upon faith in God and brings about a credited righteousness.

### Consider Briefly

1. What does it mean to receive a credit for something?
2. Read Romans 5:12 & 6:23; Isaiah 64:6

---

When we read that God counted Abraham's belief in His promise to him as righteousness we begin to see the economy of grace that God has worked with throughout redemptive history. Our sin creates an enormous debt that only God can deal with. Our good deeds are not sufficient to overcome the burden of debt that sin lays upon us. Our good deeds are themselves, unclean and filthy in the sight of God. We need a credited righteousness that only comes by the will and Spirit of God through faith.

## People of Faith

> Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you shall all the nations be blessed.” So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.

## Cursed by the Law

> For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, “Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the Book of the Law, and do them.” Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for “The righteous shall live by faith.” But the law is not of faith, rather “The one who does them shall live by them.”

> (Galatians 3:10-12 ESV)

...

## Redeemed in Christ

> Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree”—so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.
>
> (Galatians 3:13-14 ESV)
