# Introduction

The subjects of Law and Grace have fueled consistent debate and conflict since the church's earliest days. Paul addresses this conflict as faced by the churches of Galatia in the form of a letter he sent to them. There is some dispute about the exact time and ocassion that prompted Paul to send this letter to a church he had helped found, but evidence would seem to support a dating shortly before Paul's visit to Jerusalem for the Jerusalem Council around 50 AD<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>. 

The letter to the Galatians is meant to address a conflict arising directly from the teachings of a group that have come to be known as the Judaizers. While some more modern scholars have sought to adjust or rethink who Paul's opponents may have been at the time of his writing, the internal content of the letter itself makes clear that the traditional view is the most plausible<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>. Those who opposed Paul were a group who claimed to believe in the Gospel, but who had mixed in a degree of Judaism which ultimately subverted the grace that was the very heart of the Gospel they purported to believe. Ultimately this letter is Paul's appeal to the Galatians to remember the importance of grace and to reject the attempts to subject them to spiritual slavery through a misunderstanding of the Law.

For us, today, we come to Galatians as those still caught in an age prone to legalism like that of the Judaizers. We aren't necessarily tempted to embrace the same rules, but we are no less prone to establish man-made rules and regulations which are not supported by Scripture. Our difficulty is to understand the right relationship between the Law and Grace; and, Galatians, perhaps more than any other New Testament writing, helps to give us the basic framework for understanding that relationship, in light of the person and work of Jesus Christ.

### Consider Briefly

1. What works does God require for a person to be considered righteous, blameless, and without fault?
2. To what degree can we measure up to such standards in our own ability?

Take some time to consider those two questions above. Think about them, if you can, from two different perspectives. How would you answer them as a non-Christian? And, how would you answer them as a Christian?

# Galatians 1:1-5

## Paul, an apostle

> Paul, an apostle — not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead
>
> (Galatians 1:1 ESV)

What does it mean for Paul to call himself an apostle? The word, literally, means a messenger or representative. But, as we look at this first verse of the letter to the Galatians, what does it mean for Paul to say what he does right here?

Paul asserts three key aspects of his apostleship:

* It is not from men
* It is not through men
* It is through Jesus and God the Father

What do these three things mean as we consider who Paul is and how we should understand the nature of his writing to a group of believers in the region of Galatia?

The audience that Paul is writing to are, likely, new believers who have been swept up by a set of false teachings. The particular false teachers have sought to undermine Paul's credibility by denying his apostolic authority. For this reason, Paul opens his letter with a brief statement on the source of his apostolic calling, and reiterates that it is not by the power or authority of men, but is a calling that is his because of the work of God ([Acts 9:1-31](http://www.esvbible.org/Acts%209%3A1-31/)).

This verse also includes a statement that, given the likely early date for the writing of this letter in Paul's ministry, underscores the centrality of a key teaching of _orthodox_<sup id="a3">[3](#f3)</sup> Christianity: the historical reality of the resurrection of Jesus. This theme will recurr elsewhere in Paul's writings as an essential element of how the early church understood the message of the Gospel and its unique historical claims ([1 Corinthians 15:17-20](http://www.esvbible.org/1%20Corinthians%2015%3A17-20/)).

## Warm Greetings

> [A]nd all the brothers who are with me, To the churches of Galatia: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,
>  
> (Galatians 1:2-3 ESV)

Paul addresses the churches of Galatia with warmth in his opening greeting. The contrast of this greeting with what follows in verse six is quite jarring. But, we know from Paul's ministry that he loved dearly the churches that he had helped to establish. We see this reality reflected in his offering of "grace and peace." And, we see the Gospel-saturation of Paul's love for this church in what follows.

Yet, Paul does not write alone. This is not an uncommon thing for Paul. In other letters he sends greetings on behalf of other companions of his in ministry. Here, he relays greetings from an unspecified number of fellow believers who are with him.

---

### Consider Briefly

1. Why is it significant that Paul is not simply writing as an apostle?
2. What does it lend to the character of the letter to associate this letter with other believers?

---

He specifically calls out this unknown set of companions as brothers. The Greek word used denotes a sibling relationship and, while not gender neutral, would be gender inclusive in this sort of context. This familial language used by Paul is important for us to grasp as we understand the affection that Paul has for those to whom he is writing, as well as how even we should seek to deal with those who err in our own churches.

The commentator Gerhard Ebeling wrote of Paul's language in these versions like so:

> Christians are brothers as the children of the heavenly Father, a status to which they are called and of which they are assured through Jesus Christ. They are not children of the Father by nature but by grace, not by birth but by virtue of rebirth, as belonging to one and the same Lord, they are made each other’s equals. None of them is Lord over the others, not even the apostle!<sup id="a4">[4](#f4)</sup>

This familial connection thus underpins why Paul invokes his companions as a support to what is soon to become a very difficult letter, in terms of subject matter. It is also very important for us to observe that Paul refers to God as "our Father" in the context of this greeting. Paul is affirming that he stills recognizes a familial connection with the Galatian believers. They are not yet so far from the Gospel that they can't be called back and Paul recognizes this in the subtle wording of his greeting to them.

## Gospel Greetings

> [W]ho gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
>
> (Galatians 1:4-5 ESV)

In the preceding verse Paul establishes the grace and peace he offers to the Galatians upon the grace and peace that comes from God the Father and Jesus Christ. He then elaborates on four key things accomplished through the work of Jesus for both himself and the Galatian believers:

* Jesus gave himself for our sins
* Jesus gave himself to deliver us for the present evil age
* Jesus acted according to the Father's will
* Jesus acted for the Father's glory

---

### Consider Briefly

1. What does it mean to believe that Jesus gave himself for our sins?
2. What does it tell us about the nature of the Gospel that the focus is solely on the person and work of Jesus?

---

As we consider what Paul presents here, we should acknowledge that Paul understands the Gospel to be a work exclusively tied to the life, death and resurrection of Jesus. No mention is made of the believer contributing anything to their salvation. This is a theme that will be repeated over and over again as we delve further into this letter. At the heart of the message is ensuring a correct understanding of grace and the Gospel, which then allows the believer to understand the Law in its proper place.

### For Next Time

1. Read [Galatians 1:6-9](http://www.esvbible.org/Galatians%201%3A6-9/)
2. What is the Gospel, as you understand it?
3. How are you tempted to distort the Gospel, either through addition or subtraction?
4. Why is it sometimes appealing to add rules for ourselves and others?
