# Introduction

The subjects of Law and Grace have fueled consistent debate and conflict since the church's earliest days. Paul addresses this conflict as faced by the Galatian church in the form of a letter he sent to them. There is some dispute about the exact time and ocassion that prompted Paul to send this letter to a church he had helped found, but evidence would seem to support a dating shortly before Paul's visit to Jerusalem for the Jerusalem Council around 50 AD<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>.

The letter to the Galatians is meant to address a conflict arising directly from the teachings of a group that have come to be known as the Judaizers. While some more modern scholars have sought to adjust or rethink who Paul's opponents may have been at the time of his writing, the internal content of the letter itself makes clear that the traditional view is the most plausible<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>. Those who opposed Paul were a group who claimed to believe in the Gospel, but who had mixed in a degree of Judaism which ultimately subverted the grace that was the very heart of the Gospel they purported to believe. Ultimately this letter is Paul's appeal to the Galatians to remember the importance of grace and to reject the attempts to subject them to spiritual slavery through a misunderstanding of the Law.

## Consider Briefly

1. What works does God require for a person to be considered righteous, blameless, and without fault?
2. To what degree can we measure up to such standards in our own ability?

Take some time to consider those two questions above. Think about them, if you can, from two different perspectives. How would you answer them as a non-Christian? And, how would you answer them as a Christian?

# Galatians 1:1-5

## Paul, an apostle

> Paul, an apostle — not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead
>
> (Galatians 1:1 ESV)

What does it mean for Paul to call himself an apostle? The word, literally, means a messenger or representative. But, as we look at this first verse of the letter to the Galatians, what does it mean for Paul to say what he does right here?

Paul asserts three key aspects of his apostleship:

* It is not from men
* It is not through men
* It is through Jesus and God the Father

What do these three things mean as we consider who Paul is and how we should understand the nature of his writing to a group of believers in the region of Galatia?

The audience that Paul is writing to are, likely, new believers who have been swept up by a set of false teachings. The particular false teachers have sought to undermine Paul's credibility by denying his apostolic authority. For this reason, Paul opens his letter with a brief statement on the source of his apostolic calling, and reiterates that it is not by the power or authority of men, but is a calling that is his because of the work of God ([Acts 9:1-31](http://www.esvbible.org/Acts%209%3A1-31/)).

This verse also includes a statement that, given the likely early date for the writing of this letter in Paul's ministry, underscores the centrality of a key teaching of _orthodox_<sup id="a3">[3](#f3)</sup> Christianity: the historical reality of the resurrection of Jesus.
