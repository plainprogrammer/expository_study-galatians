# Galatians 1:10-17

Last session we focussed on the singular nature of the Gospel. Paul made it clear that there is no room for altering the Gospel, either by addition or subtraction from the essential message. Paul also made it clear that anyone who tampers with the Gospel is subject to God's wrath. This helps us understand the seriousness of Paul's letter to the Galatians and why we ought to be on guard against those temptations that can come to us to distort the Gospel, even with the best of intentions.

This session, along with the three that follow will examine aspects of Paul's call to Apostolic ministry and the particular ministry to the Gentiles that He was given. As we consider Paul's calling and ministry, let us think about how each believer is also called to ministry as well.

## Who's Approval Matters?

> For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ.
> 
> (Galatians 1:10 ESV)

Right on the heels of Paul asserting the damnable error that it would be to tamper with the Gospel, he asks a set of rhetorical questions and gives us a pointed answer. In the questions presented, and the answer provided we are given a stark contrast with regards to pleasing man and pleasing God.

---

### Consider Briefly

1. What are some ways that we tend to seek the approval of man?
2. How are those impulses to seek man's approval at odds with being faithful to God?

## Called By God

> For I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel that was preached by me is not man's gospel. For I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.
> 
> (Galatians 1:11-12 ESV)

In some ways these two verses reiterate what we discussed last session in terms of God being the source of the Gospel and that being something that should give us hope. But, it also highlights the peculiarity of Paul's calling.

---

### Consider Briefly

1. Read Acts 1:21-26
2. What were the qualifications that Peter outlined for Apostleship?
3. What was the primary reason for the raising of a new Apostle?
4. Read Acts 9:1-22
5. How was Paul qualified?

---

Paul was qualified by a revelation of Jesus, which came with a special calling.
 
* Read Acts 9:3-5
* Read Acts 9:15-16

Paul was specifically confronted by the resurrected Jesus about the persecution he was bringing upon the church, and Jesus. And Jesus declared his intentions to Ananias that Paul would be a messenger amongst the Gentiles.

## Paul's Zeal for Judaism

> For you have heard of my former life in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it. And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers.
>  
> (Galatians 1:13-14 ESV)

Paul was not satisfied in pursuing Judaism half-heartedly. He allowed his zeal for the traditions of the Jews to drive him to violently oppose the Gospel. He was present at the stoning of Stephen and sought to see other Christians jailed and killed. 

---

### Consider Briefly

1. Before you came to know Jesus, what were the things you were zealous for?
2. How did your zeal keep you from seeing the Gospel clearly?

---

## Paul's Unusual Preparation

Despite Paul violently persecuting the church, he was not too far from the reach of God.

> But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and who called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son to me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone; nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.
>
> (Galatians 1:15-17 ESV)

Paul recognized God's work in his life as something that was not just about the experiences of his life, but about God's bigger plan.

---

### Consider Briefly

1. How did God get a hold of you and overcome your resistance to the Gospel?

---

Not all of us will have the experience of having been strongly resistant to the Gospel. Thankfully, God worked in the lives of many to bring about salvation early in our lives and reconciling us to Himself without the need to break down barriers we had erected against Him. But, for others we ought to recognize that our salvation and the work of God overcoming our resistance is the kind of thing that God is pleased to do. He has intentions that go beyond the scope of our individual lives.

---

### Consider Briefly

1. Read 1 Peter 2:9-10
2. Read 2 Corinthians 5:17-21

---

We are not called like Paul was to the office of Apostle, but God has been working out the same eternal plan in our salvation as He worked out in the life of Paul. We are still called to a great, Gospel-oriented, ministry.

---

### Consider Briefly

1. What are the ways that God has led you to be engage in the "ministry of reconciliation"?
2. What are the ways that God has given you opportunity to proclaim the "message of reconciliation"?
3. How can we better support and encourage one another to be engaged with both the ministry and message og the Gospel?

---

All of us who are in Christ have a role to play in advancing the Gospel. We are not called to the same Apostolic ministry as Paul, but we are called to be both ministers and message bearers. We are priests of a greater covenant than any that had been known before.

---

### For Next Time

1. Look for opportunities to pursue the ministry of reconciliation and to proclaim the reconciling message of the Gospel
2. Read Galatians 1:18-24
3. How is God glorified in transforming the lives of sinners?
4. How is God glorified by the ministries of those He has redeemed?
