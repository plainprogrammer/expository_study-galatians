# Galatians 2:11-16

In the verses we are looking at in this session Paul concludes his use of his own biography as a defense for his ministry. And, in this particular aspect of Paul's life experience we learn a great deal about the nature of Apostolic ministry, the risk of partiality, and the beginning of Paul's primary purpose in writing to the Galatians.

### Consider Briefly

1. Why is salvation by works so enticing to so many, even within the church?

---

As we proceed through this session we should keep in mind why the answers to this question matter. Many will be directly addressed and undercut by the arguments that Paul makes throughout the rest of this letter, beginning in the last verses we will look at. But, before we get there, we have one more detail of Paul's biography to examine.

## No One is Above Correction

> But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. For before certain men came from James, he was eating with the Gentiles; but when they came he drew back and separated himself, fearing the circumcision party.
> 
> (Galatians 2:11-12 ESV)

...

## Hypocrisy Worth Calling Out

> And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically along with him, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.
> 
> (Galatians 2:13 ESV)

...

## Gospel Correction

> But when I saw that their conduct was not in step with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, “If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?”
> 
> (Galatians 2:14 ESV)

...

## Justified by Faith

> We ourselves are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners; yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.
