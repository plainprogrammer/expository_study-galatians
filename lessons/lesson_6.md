# Galatians 2:11-16

In the verses we are looking at in this session Paul concludes his use of his own biography as a defense for his ministry. And, in this particular aspect of Paul's life experience we learn a great deal about the nature of Apostolic ministry, the risk of partiality, and the beginning of Paul's primary purpose in writing to the Galatians.

### Consider Briefly

1. Why is salvation by works so enticing to so many, even within the church?

---

As we proceed through this session we should keep in mind why the answers to this question matter. Many will be directly addressed and undercut by the arguments that Paul makes throughout the rest of this letter, beginning in the last verses we will look at. But, before we get there, we have one more detail of Paul's biography to examine.

## No One is Above Correction

> But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. For before certain men came from James, he was eating with the Gentiles; but when they came he drew back and separated himself, fearing the circumcision party.
> 
> (Galatians 2:11-12 ESV)

Earlier in our study we looked at how Paul had spent a number of days getting to know the Apostle Peter and his ministry. Paul had also spent time in Jerusalem with Peter and other leaders of the church there. But, the cooperative relationship they had in the Gospel was not without boundaries.

### Consider Briefly

1. Why is it remarkable that Paul would confront Peter directly?
2. Why do you think who Peter was eating with mattered to some?

---

Many denominations make a big deal about the authority of their leadership. The Roman Catholic church invests a great deal of authority in the office of Pope. The Latter-day Saints (Mormon) church even claims to have twelve living Apostles leading their institution, with a living prophet as chief among them. But, we see that even the Apostle Peter was not above being confronted, and corrected, for his hypocrisy.

All church leaders are potentially fallible. The degree of authority any leader in the church possesses is directly proportional to the degree to which they are being faithful to Scripture.

### Consider Briefly

1. Read 2 Timothy 3:14-17
2. What is Scripture good for?
3. Read 2 Peter 3:15-16

Scripture is the final, sole, and sufficient source of all truth pertaining to faith and godliness. In particular we know we can recognize the Old and New Testaments as Scripture because of the abundant attestation of the Scriptures themselves to their own reliability, as well as the testimony of the church through the ages, and the Holy Spirit. And, it is precisely because of the presence of a reliable external authority that no leader within the church, at any time in history, can be above correction based on the truth of Scripture.

Beyond that, however, the specific hypocrisy that Paul calls out on the part of Peter was in connection with who he chose to associate with for meals. Luke 15:2 recounts a similar criticism levelled at Jesus for his choice of dining companions, as well. Likely some of the criticism would have been connected with who Peter was dining with, but another aspect would have also been concern over the food being eaten. Leviticus 11 prescribes dietary standards for faithful Jews, and those who were concerned with circumcision in the life of the church would certainly also have been concerned with what Christians were choosing to eat as well.

## Hypocrisy Worth Calling Out

> And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically along with him, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.
> 
> (Galatians 2:13 ESV)

---

### Consider Briefly

1. Why do you think Paul calls out Peter's and the other Jews' behavior as hypocrisy? 
2. What danger do we see presented here that results from hypocrisy?

---

The truth is that these, supposed Jewish Christians, were being somewhat consistent in their practices. They were expecting the practice of the Mosaic Law to continue within the life of the Christian community. But, Paul called that consistency out as hypocrisy. The exact reason he calls it out will be a focal point for the rest of this study. But, the short reason why their consistency was hypocritical was that they claimed to be under the grace and mercy of Jesus' work, while seeking to subject themselves and others to the Law's demands, which include a defunct and powerless sacrificial system.

And, we see the danger inherent in even consistent hypocrisy in that it was able to draw away a co-laborer with Paul: Barnabas. When we tolerate teachings that are out of step with Gospel truth we are inviting others to be led astray. When we fail to be sufficient defenders of truth, we run the very real risk of seeing those close to us slip into error and hypocrisy.

## Gospel Correction

> But when I saw that their conduct was not in step with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, “If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?”
> 
> (Galatians 2:14 ESV)

The Gospel demands that we be defenders of the truth, even if that means speaking pointedly with those who are in positions of leadership. Gospel correction requires that we point out the errors that others are committing, this is the very heart of what we see in Matthew 18:15-20. No one is above correction, but our correction must always come from a place of truth and love and with the goal of redemption being at the forefront of our concerns.

Paul lived this out in his confrontation with Peter over his hypocrisy. The reality that even the Apostle Peter was not above correction should embolden us all to be defenders of Gospel truth. This reality does not give us license to be harsh or unloving in our manner of addressing error, but it does give us the freedom to know that error is not just something those in leadership are empowered to confront. We all need correction from time to time, whether on points of doctrine or practice. We should lovingly seek to offer needed corrections whenever the occasion arises.

## Justified by Faith

> We ourselves are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners; yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.
