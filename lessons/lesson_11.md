# Galatians 4:8-20

In our last lesson we reviewed how Paul has presented the distinction between Law & Gospel. We reviewed how Paul presented the Abrahamic covenant as central to his argument against believing that the Law could bring salvation. Paul will resume his argument with relation to Sarah and Hagar in verse twenty-one of this chapter. But, before he returns to further distinguishing the Law from the Gospel, Paul will plead directly with the Galatians concerning their salvation.

## Knowing God

> Formerly, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to those that by nature are not gods. But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world, whose slaves you want to be once more?
> 
> (Galatians 4:8-9 ESV)

...

## New Idols

> You observe days and months and seasons and years! I am afraid I may have labored over you in vain.
> 
> (Galatians 4:10-11 ESV)

...

## Once Received Gladly

> Brothers, I entreat you, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You did me no wrong. You know it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached the gospel to you at first, and though my condition was a trial to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus. What then has become of your blessedness? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me.
> 
> (Galatians 4:12-15 ESV)

...

## Now Despised

> Have I then become your enemy by telling you the truth? They make much of you, but for no good purpose. They want to shut you out, that you may make much of them. It is always good to be made much of for a good purpose, and not only when I am present with you, my little children, for whom I am again in the anguish of childbirth until Christ is formed in you! I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.
>   
> (Galatians 4:16-20 ESV)
