# Galatians 4:8-20

In our last lesson we reviewed how Paul has presented the distinction between Law & Gospel. We reviewed how Paul presented the Abrahamic covenant as central to his argument against believing that the Law could bring salvation. Paul will resume his argument with relation to Sarah and Hagar in verse twenty-one of this chapter. But, before he returns to further distinguishing the Law from the Gospel, Paul will plead directly with the Galatians concerning their salvation.

## Knowing God

> Formerly, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to those that by nature are not gods. But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world, whose slaves you want to be once more?
> 
> (Galatians 4:8-9 ESV)

The understanding of where we came from prior to knowing Jesus as savior is an important detail for Christians. Prior to knowing God as Lord all believers were enslaved to idols of some form or fashion. We tend to think of idolatry as an ancient practice, or as an expression of primitive belief. But, idolatry is just as much a reality for modern people as it was amongst Paul's audience.

### Consider Briefly

1. What is idolatry?
2. Read Exodus 20:3-6; 1 Corinthians 8:4-6
3. What things do we idolize in our culture?

---

Idolatry is the worshipping of anything other than the God who created all things. We don't often think of ourselves as worshipping many of the things that we can and should identify as idols in the modern age, but that does not change their idolatrous nature. Many worship and pursue success or money above all else. Some exalt the idea of the family in a way that distorts their understanding of God Himself. Others worship at the altar of the human intellect and ability to know and study the world around us. In all of these idols the worship of God is made less important, or discarded altogether.

Anything that hinders us from worshipping God is an idol. But, as Paul points out, the idol is hollow and meaningless. Idols lack any real existence for themselves. Among the Galatians, Paul appeals to the reality that they had come out of lives worshipping false gods, idols of their own imaginations. But, he also points out that they are turning back to the same kind of slavery that they had, supposedly, left.

But, Paul also makes an important note about what it means for any believer to know God. He identifies that it is really about God knowing us. God is, again, presented as the sole sufficient actor with regards to our salvation. Our knowledge of Him is entirely conditioned on His knowledge of us, and His salvific intent towards us.

## New Idols

> You observe days and months and seasons and years! I am afraid I may have labored over you in vain.
> 
> (Galatians 4:10-11 ESV)

---

### Consider Briefly

1. What do you think Paul is referring to regarding days, months, seasons and years?
2. Read Leviticus 23:1-3
3. Why should the Galatians' concerns for such things concern Paul?

---

The days, months, seasons and years that Paul is referring to were likely the appointed observances of the Law in terms of Sabbaths, feasts, and the like. Paul uses very strong language to express his concern: "I am afraid I may have labored over you in vain." No one likes to see their hard work wasted or disregarded. And, that is precisely how Paul describes the nature of his concern at the idea that the Galatians are turning to the Law and the observance of its shadows with any kind of seriousness.

Paul identifies the observance of the Law in this way as being like the idolatry that the Galatians had come out of. The concern for Paul is the false hope that is being given to the Galatians. Instead of hoping in Christ, the Galatians are placing their hope in the shadow that preceded the coming of Jesus. The danger of idolatry is it entices us to place our hope somewhere it doesn't belong and in something that can not satisfy, or save, us.

## Once Received Gladly

> Brothers, I entreat you, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You did me no wrong. You know it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached the gospel to you at first, and though my condition was a trial to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus. What then has become of your blessedness? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me.
> 
> (Galatians 4:12-15 ESV)

...

## Now Despised

> Have I then become your enemy by telling you the truth? They make much of you, but for no good purpose. They want to shut you out, that you may make much of them. It is always good to be made much of for a good purpose, and not only when I am present with you, my little children, for whom I am again in the anguish of childbirth until Christ is formed in you! I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.
>   
> (Galatians 4:16-20 ESV)
