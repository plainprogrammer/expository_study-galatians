# Galatians 4:21-31

Paul returns in the verses we will be studying today to his Abrahamic argument, making an analogy connecting the Law and Gospel to Abraham's two sons: Ishmael and Isaac. The focus for Paul is the nature of the inheritance each had in relation to the promises God had made and how that is related to God's promises that are connected with the Law and the Gospel. The emphasis for Paul is the what the results of faith in the Law versus the Gospel are and how they stand in stark contrast with one another.

## Two Sons, Two Paths

> Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not listen to the law? For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and one by a free woman. But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, while the son of the free woman was born through promise.

## An Allegory of Two Covenants

> Now this may be interpreted allegorically: these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar. Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children. But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.

## Greater are the Children of Barrenness

> For it is written, "Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear; break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor! For the children of the desolate one will be more than those of the one who has a husband.”
> (Galatians 4:27 ESV; cf. Isaiah 54:1)

## Children of Promise, Not Slavery

> Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise. But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now. But what does the Scripture say? “Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.” So, brothers, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman.
