# Galatians 1:18-24

In our last session we dealt with the inability of pleasing both man and God as Paul begins to describe his calling and ministry as an Apostle. We discussed how for each believer, while we are not called by special revelation from Jesus, like Paul was, we are all particularly called to faith and ministry. This session will continue our examination of Paul's calling and ministry, with specific emphasis on how God is glorified in the work that He does in each of our lives.

### Consider Briefly

1. What opportunities have you had this past week to pursue the ministry of reconciliation or proclaim the message of reconciliation?

## Meeting the Other Apostles

> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and remained with him fifteen days. But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord's brother.
>
> (Galatians 1:18-19 ESV)

Part of the purpose of Paul telling the Galatians so much of his Apostolic autobiography is related to his defense of his Apostleship. In the opening of his defense he focused on the special revelation that came with both his conversion and calling. In these verses, Paul transitions to connecting his calling with the ministry of the other Apostles. In doing this he is emphasizing both a degree of continuity and discontinuity.
 
Paul emphasized in the earlier portion of his story the direct nature of his conversion and calling, emphasizing the discontinuity of his ministry in relation to that of the other Apostles and identifying that he was not seeking to please men with his ministry to the Gentiles. Now he is seeking to connect his ministry with that of the other Apostles as a means of establishing a continuity which would serve to silence a different kind of critic: those who asserted Paul was not preaching the same Gospel as the other Apostles.
 
By Paul's account his first visit with any other Apostle centers on a visit with Peter that lasted fifteen days. The word used in this passage that is most often translated as "to visit" is not as benign as the translation would lead us to believe. Its meaning wraps up the ideas of inquiry, examination and the gaining of knowledge. So, it seems that Paul's intent in visiting with Peter was to learn from him.

### Consider Briefly

1. What value do you think Paul received from getting to know Peter?
2. When we meet other believers, how do we get to know them?
3. How can or should we improve the ways that we "visit" with other believers?

## Continued Ministry

> (In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie!) Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. And I was still unknown in person to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.
>
> (Galatians 1:20-22 ESV)

### Consider Briefly

1. Why do you think Paul makes such a strong affirmation of the truth of his biography here?

---

The placement of Paul's appeal to the truth of what he is writing would seem to indicate that those who were opposing Paul in Galatia were doing so specifically in relation to the manner by which he came to be a preacher of the Gospel. That Paul connects his ministry both to a special revelation from Jesus and to the ministry of Peter, in particular, is likely meant to undercut the specific types of attacks being levelled against him.

### Consider Briefly

1. In your experience what are the things that false teachers, or non-believers, tend to use in attempting to undercut the Gospel we proclaim?
2. How can we better respond to such attacks on the truthfulness of the message we proclaim?

---

Responding to criticism is something Christians have been well acquainted with for centuries. There are always those who are opposed to the truth either from supposedly Christian perspectives or not. Apologetics, Church History and other areas of study that Christians can engage in are tools that can help us address specific kinds of objections that come against us. They can never replace the Gospel. They can only shut down opposition. They can not bring about repentance and faith in and of themselves. Our responses to critics must always also bring them and us back the the Gospel message itself.

As Paul continues his ministry after meeting with Peter and James he is travelling and remaining, personally, unknown to the churches in Judea. They are hearing about his ministry, but they have not yet met Paul himself. The most interesting aspect of how the churches respond to Paul's ministry is then revealed in the last verses we will look at today.

## Glorifying God

> They only were hearing it said, “He who used to persecute us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.” And they glorified God because of me.
> 
> (Galatians 1:23-24 ESV)

The churches were hearing about the ministry of Paul and they were glorifying God. This is instructive for us, but before we get to that, note that Paul is still telling this part of the story as a means of defending himself. He is citing the response of churches that had not met him to the work that he was doing. He is highlighting the continuity of his teaching with that of the rest of the church.

---

### Consider Briefly

1. How do you respond when you hear about other believers being faithful to the Gospel? Is it always and consistently positive?
2. What keeps you from glorifying God when you hear about the faithful ministry of others?
3. In what ways can and should we glorify God when we hear about or see Him moving in His church?

---

God is glorified in calling sinners to Himself and then using them to advance His kingdom. We sometimes fail to give glory to God adequately when He does these things. Sometimes we get hung up on matters that should give us real concern: such as those who are evangelized but not connected with a local church for the work of discipleship. But, sometimes we fail to give glory to God for truly petty reasons that arise out of the reality that we're still struggling against our old natures.

We ought to look for opportunities to glorify God for what He is doing, and we know that He is always moving in His church. And, more that that, we should endeavor to live in such a way that other believers will give glory to God because of what they hear about the way God is moving in and through us.

### For Next Time

1. Find something this week that God is doing that we should glorify Him for and bring it back to share with the group next session.
2. Read Galatians 2:1-10
3. What are the things that help regulate your Christian life and keep you from straying into error?
