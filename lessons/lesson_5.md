# Galatians 2:1-10

In our last session we looked at the second part of Paul's two-fold defense of his ministry and message. We saw how Paul's meeting with Peter was intended to connect Paul to the work of the other Apostles. Additionally, we saw how Paul's transformation at the power of the Holy Spirit and the revelation of Jesus, Himself, was cause for the churches to glorify God.

This week we want to focus on those things that encourage us to continue abiding and laboring in and for the cause of the Gospel. We continue to see Paul using his own autobiography to teach important truths about not just his ministry, but also about our lives and ministry in Christ.

### Consider Briefly

1. What is God doing that we should give glory to Him for, here and around the world, in the church?
2. What things help regulate your Christian life?
3. Why is it important, as a Christian, to not rely solely on your own opinions and experience?

## Affirming the Truth

> Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along with me. I went up because of a revelation and set before them (though privately before those who seemed influential) the gospel that I proclaim among the Gentiles, in order to make sure I was not running or had not run in vain.
> 
> (Galatians 2:1-2 ESV)

As Paul continued his ministry he did not isolate himself and seek to pursue his own agenda. While we may think the interval described here sounds like a very long time, it is actually likely that this is 14 years after Paul's conversion, not after his stay with Peter. Also, we know with the travels of Paul and the other Apostles that some other interactions, whether in person or via letters or messengers was likely to have occurred.

In the church today, too many believers willingly isolate themselves. Some feel they have a calling that must be pursued whether anyone, or any church, is willing to support them in it. The model of the supposed lone-ranger Christian is far too common. But, the Christian life is not meant to be lived in such a way. We are called by Scripture to live in community with one another and to seek wise counsel.

### Consider Briefly

1. Read the following passages
    * Proverbs 12:15
    * Proverbs 19:20-21
    * 1 John 4:1
    * 2 Timothy 3:16
    * Hebrews 13:17
2. What keeps you from seeking Godly counsel sometimes?
3. Why is it important to seek the input of others?
4. How else ought we to judge counsel and our own opinions?

As we look at Paul's example here we see him conferring with Godly men, leaders in the church at Jerusalem to confirm that what he is preaching is true. Paul wants to ensure that he is not "running ... in vain." Paul wants to make sure that the Gospel, as he understands it is the same Gospel preached by the church as a whole. He is seeking unity in message and fellowship with other believers.

We have an amazing advantage that Paul and the rest of the church lacked in those formative years. We have the benefit of all of Scripture to inform our opinions and give us a foundation for testing the spirits and examining the teachings of others. We often to not take this advantage as seriously as we should and we suffer as individuals and the church when we do not turn first to Scripture to shape, correct and govern our opinions. But, we also have the advantage of time. The church has experienced a lot over the last 2000 years and we ought to avail ourselves of the wisdom of those faithful believers who have gone before us, in addition to the ones that serve the church today. 

## Resisting Error

> But even Titus, who was with me, was not forced to be circumcised, though he was a Greek. Yet because of false brothers secretly brought in—who slipped in to spy out our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might bring us into slavery—to them we did not yield in submission even for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you. 
>
> (Galatians 2:3-5 ESV)

Paul draws our attention to the way he and his companions resisted false teachers who sought to bind them under rules that were foreign to the Gospel. In this specific instance it is the subject of circumcision that was raised by individuals who Paul refers to as "false brothers." This is an important issue in this context because the false teachers that are troubling the Galatians are likely the same, or very closely linked, to these false teachers in Jerusalem.

Yet, Paul notes the reason that he resisted their false teachings. It was for the sake of the Galatians, as well as numerous other Gentile believers. This reveals to us a sound reason why we should also resist false teachings when they crop up in our day and age. We should do so for the sake of those who may struggle around us, and for those who are still yet to believe the Gospel.

### Consider Briefly

1. What are some errors that the church struggles with today that we need to be committed to resisting?
2. How can we, as a local community of believers help each other to resist false teaching?
3. What value does resisting false teaching provide for us in seeking to share the Gospel with others?

## One Faith

> And from those who seemed to be influential (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)—those, I say, who seemed influential added nothing to me. On the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised (for he who worked through Peter for his apostolic ministry to the circumcised worked also through me for mine to the Gentiles), and when James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.
