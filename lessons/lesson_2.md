# Galatians 1:6-9

In the last session we examined Paul's greeting to the churches of Galatia. We saw how he rooted it in an affirmation of the Gospel message, cited his calling as an apostle and expressed a shared concern for the Galatian believers from other believers who were with him.

At the end of our last session we raised three questions for consideration that we want to discuss before moving forward.

---

### Consider Briefly

1. What is the Gospel, as you understand it?
2. How are you tempted to distort the Gospel, either through addition or subtraction?
3. Why is it sometimes appealing to add rules for ourselves and others?

## Turning from the Truth

> I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel
> 
> (Galatians 1:6 ESV)

The tone of Paul's writing to the Galatians shifts in verse six. The pleasantries are done and Paul dives directly into the matter concerning him as he writes to the Galatian churches. What stands out in this first verse about what is causing Paul so much concern, and, as he puts it, astonishes him?

* How quickly they are turning from grace
* How quickly they are turning to a different, so-called, gospel

Let's take a moment to consider what Paul is saying in this verse. The Galatians had heard the Gospel call, rooted in grace. They had heard the message that Paul embeds into his greeting to them in verses four and five. Yet, they are turning away from grace and to something else. What could be so enticing?

---

### Consider Briefly

1. What things tempt us to turn away from the grace that is inherent to the Gospel message?
2. What helps you resist those temptations to turn from grace?
3. Look at the verse six again, who are we abandoning when we turn from grace? Who is it that calls us to Christ in the first place? (see John 6:43-5)

## There is No Other Gospel

> [N]ot that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.
>
> (Galatians 1:7 ESV)

There is no other Gospel. At the end of it all there is one way that God has appointed for the salvation of humanity. Paul is unshakable in this affirmation. Yet, the Galatians have been drawn away. They have been tempted to pursue a false teaching, and we see some of the characteristics of all false teaching laid out:

* False teaching causes "trouble" — through division, confusion and doubt
* False teaching rests on "distortion" - half-truths are complete lies

Consider a portion of Jesus' High Priestly Prayer in John 17:11 — what does he want for his followers, those whom the Father has given to him?

Jesus desires for His church to be unified. But that unity is not at the expense of truth, it is rooted in truth, because He desires for the unity of the church to be exemplary of the unity that even He has with the Father. Yet, false teaching does not unite, it always divides. Charity is lost when false teaching arises.

---

### Consider Briefly

1. What are some examples of false teachings and they way they bring division, confusion and doubt with respect to the truth of the Gospel?
2. Of the examples brought up, what are the specific ways these false teachings distort the truth?

---

## May False Teachings Be Accursed

> But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.
>
> (Galatians 1:8-9 ESV)

---

### Consider Briefly

1. Who has the authority to change the Gospel?
2. What does the unchangeable nature of the Gospel tell us about God?
3. Why is that good news?

---

The Gospel can not be changed, because God can not be changed. And, that means we can have real hope if we are in Christ. Hope can not truly exist unless the Gospel is fixed and unchanging. Our hope is derived from the constancy of God Himself and the certainty that when Christ yielded His life as an atonement for sin it was good enough then, now and forever.

No creature can change the Gospel message, and if they try they are _anathema_. That term, which is the transliteration of the Greek word translated as 'accursed' means a thing devoted to destruction. Tampering with the Gospel is a serious matter because it places a person squarely in the cross-hairs of God's wrath. And Paul invokes this potentiality even upon himself to demonstrate the seriousness of the matter.

---

### Consider Briefly

1. Look back to verses one, four and five. What are the key elements of the Gospel message?

---

We must hold firmly to what God has revealed through His son to us as being the heart of the Gospel:

* Jesus died for our sins
* Jesus died to deliver us from the present evil age
* Jesus died according to the will of the Father
* The Father raised Jesus from the dead

At the heart of the Gospel are these essential truths. And to add to or take away from any of them is to invite God's wrath upon oneself. We must be watchful then to not allow false teachers to sow amongst us the seeds of division, confusion, doubt or distortion that would lead us to turn aside from the Gospel that is able to save. Indeed, this is the only message that can save: God's amazing grace.

### For Next Time

1. Read [Galatians 1:10-17](http://www.esvbible.org/Galatians%201%3A6-9/)
2. What does Paul mean by speaking of "seeking the approval of man"?
3. Why can we not be servants of both man and of God?
