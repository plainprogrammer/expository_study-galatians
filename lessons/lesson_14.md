# Galatians 5:7-15

Last week we looked at the Paul's continued rejection of the saving power of the Law in contrast to his acceptance of the Gospel. The focus was specifically on the practice of circumcision, which was established in Genesis 17 and carried forward as a part of the Law's demands. This week the focus will be on the qualities of false teachers.

## Hinderance to Obedience

> You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth? This persuasion is not from him who calls you.
> 
> (Galatians 5:7-8 ESV)

False teaching, while it can have the appearance of piety does not lead to an obedience that is of any true value. Instead, it leads away from true piety.

### Consider Briefly

1. How does false teaching get in the way of being obedient to the Gospel?
2. Why do false teachings have this hindering effect?

---

False teaching hinders obedience to the Gospel by making the Gospel message of less importance. False teaching fails to keep the focus on the Gospel exclusively, or it redefines the Gospel in a way that obscures the central themes. False teaching is ultimately a distraction from the simplicity of the Gospel.

## Polluting Effect

> A little leaven leavens the whole lump.
> 
> (Galatians 5:9 ESV)

...

## An Account Will Be Given

> I have confidence in the Lord that you will take no other view, and the one who is troubling you will bear the penalty, whoever he is.
> 
> (Galatians 5:10 ESV)

...

## Intolerance Abounding

> But if I, brothers, still preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been removed.
> 
> (Galatians 5:11 ESV)

...

## Harsh Opposition

> I wish those who unsettle you would emasculate themselves!
> 
> (Galatians 5:12 ESV)

...

## True Obedience

> For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.
> 
> (Galatians 5:13-15 ESV)

## For Next Time

1. Read Galataisn 5:16-26
2. In light of our freedom in Christ, how should we relate to sin, both our own and others?
3. By what means can we better stay in step with the Spirit?
4. By what means can we put to death the desires of the flesh?
