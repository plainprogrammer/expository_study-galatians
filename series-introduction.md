#  The Expository Bible Study

The Expository Bible Study is a series of Bible studies focused on exposing the depth of what the Bible teaches. It is organized as a book-by-book study with a few key principles and characteristics that distinguish it from other published Bible study curriculum:

* Jesus is the Lord and ultimate object of all of Scripture.
* Studying the Bible should encourage both evangelism and discipleship
* Bible studies should be usable in numerous settings 
* Rigid periodic structures encourage compromise in the depth of study

Each of this facets of the study are explained more below.

## Jesus in All of Scripture

> And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.
>
> (Luke 24:27 ESV)

Jesus is the obvious and consistent focus of the New Testament, but He is also throughout the Old Testament. His own act of exposing this to His disciples on the road to Emmaus should encourage us to diligently seek Him out in all of Scripture as we seek to study it.

## Reaching Out & Going Deep

> "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”
>  
> (Matthew 28:19-20 ESV)

We are to go forth and make disciples as the church, but bound up in this command is the instruction to teach. We are to reach out to those around us and encourage their obedience to all that Christ commanded. And, in order to do that, we must teach all that Jesus has said, and all that speaks truth about Him. For this reason these Bible studies are meant to be both evangelistic and educational, because it is the conviction of this series' authors that evangelism and discipleship are one in the same act in the end.

## Useful Anywhere

> All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.
>
> (2 Timothy 3:16-17 ESV)

Scripture provides us everything we need for a life of godliness. It encourages, corrects and shapes us in every meaningful way necessary for our good and the work of pursuing God's glory. Since the Bible speaks to all we need for godliness, it is useful everywhere evangelism and discipleship happen, whether in a Sunday School class, or a small group, or an coffee-shop Bible study. God's word speaks usefully anywhere we will take it.

## Take the Time You Need

> Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time, because the days are evil.
>
> (Ephesians 5:15-16 ESV)

Because the Bible has such great value for every concern and in every context, we ought to devote sufficient time to its study. This series seeks to encourage this by rejecting any kind of rigid periodic schedule for the books in the study. We want to take as much time as necessary to cover each book of the Bible well, and we want to encourage participants to devote themselves to studying the Word in their own time and away from class to get the most from each text the series addresses.
