# Leader Resources

The Expository Bible Study relies on a single commentary as the primary resource for leaders and students wishing to supplement the core lessons: [Exalting Jesus in Galatians (Christ-Centered Exposition Commentary)](http://amzn.com/0805496580) by David Platt and Tony Merida. Leaders are strongly encouraged to acquire the commentary, and it is recommended that students consider adding the commentary to their personal resource library. The following additional resources are recommended for those wishing to go even deeper with the study.
